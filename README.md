## Cleaining Data - Course Project.
### Files 
1. run_analysis.R - The script file, as asked for. This will work if UCI HAR Dataset is in the same directory as the script. To run this, either set the working directory in this script, or call ("source run_analysis.R") from the R Shell prompt or RStudio, after correctly setting the working directory.
2. CodeBook.md - A code-book which describes the transformations I made using the R script above.
3. result.txt - A file with the final tidy data set.
